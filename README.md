# ginrummy

## Description
Gin Rummy is a two player card game that is a variant of rummy.
Game built in Java in IntelliJ. IntelliJ creates a lot of its directories and files in an interesting manner, including how they are nested, so to view / run the code in the best manner I'd suggest opening the project in IntelliJ.

## Code directories
Source code available in src/com/example directory.

Test code available in test/com/example directory.

Out/ folder auto generated by IntelliJ (can ignore).

## Usage
To play the game, run main in Game.java, which runs multiple types ofthe GameEngine to play against each other.
There are 3 default strategies implemented, Random, Knock, and Append. Game.java will run all of them against each other and compare results.
